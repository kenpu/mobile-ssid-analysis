It's becoming a commonly accepted standard of living that we constantly have
access to a mobile device which is basking in a sea of Wifi hotspots.
By recording the observed Wifi signals over time, it is possible for the mobile
phone to deduce the salient locations in its environment, and the mobility
patterns of the user.  In real-life, fluctuations of the Wifi hotspots and
the unreliability of mobile phone antenna necessarily creates false readings and
missed readings, making the location identification problem and its related
problems particularly challenging.

In this paper, we propose a family of algorithms to perform the tasks of
location identification, mobility inference, and localization.  Our algorithms
are able to handle the noisy reading observed in real-life application.
Furthermore, our location identification algorithm constructs a hierarchy of
salient locations providing a multiresolution model of the environment.
