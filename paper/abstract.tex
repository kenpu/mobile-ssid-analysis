User mobile devices are nowadays constantly in a sea of WiFi hotspots.  By
recording the observed WiFi signals over time, it is possible for the mobile
phone to deduce the salient locations in its environment, and the mobility
patterns of the user.  In real life, fluctuations of WiFi hotspots and
unreliability of mobile phone antenna necessarily create false or missed
readings, making problems related to location identification particularly
challenging.

We propose a family of algorithms to perform the tasks of location
identification, mobility inference, and localization.  Our algorithms
are able to handle real-life noisy readings, and construct a hierarchy of
salient locations providing a multiresolution model of the environment. Our
system also analyzes the user-defined SSID labels and performs semantic grouping
of the physical locations to provide a user-friendly summary of the mobility
patterns.
