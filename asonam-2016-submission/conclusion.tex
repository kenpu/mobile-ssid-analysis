\section{Conclusion}

We presented an end-to-end solution to perform:

\begin{itemize}
\item Segmenting movements into a hierarchical timeline
\item Identification of persistent and transient locations
\item Labeling locations with semantic information
\end{itemize}

In contrast with existing literature, our algorithm is highly efficient and
robust.  Our algorithm is online, thus can run on a simple mobile device with
minimal requirement on storage and processing power.  The hierarchical timeline
used during the segmentation stage is particularly effective in combatting noisy
WiFi signals one observes in real life.

We have implemented the entire system as an Android app, and have demonstrated
that our algorithm is suitable for real life applications by the industry.
