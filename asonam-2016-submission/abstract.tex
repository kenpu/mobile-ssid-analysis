\begin{abstract}
    User mobile devices are nowadays constantly in a sea of WiFi hotspots.  By
    recording the observed WiFi signals over time, it is possible for the mobile
    phone to deduce the salient locations in its environment, and the mobility
    patterns of the user.  Analysis of such information has great potential in
    enriching social media applications by making them aware of the location and
    mobility information of the user.
    
    In real life, fluctuations of WiFi hotspots and
    unreliability of mobile phone antenna necessarily create false or missed
    readings, making problems related to location identification particularly
    challenging.  

    We propose a family of algorithms to perform the tasks of location
    identification, mobility inference, and localization.  Our algorithms are
    able to handle real-life noisy readings, and construct a hierarchy of
    salient locations providing a multiresolution model of the environment.
    Compare to existing algorithms in the literature, our solution is much
    more efficient and robust, making it particularly suitable for industrial
    applications.
