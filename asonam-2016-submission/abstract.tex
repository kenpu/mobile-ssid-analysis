%It's becoming a commonly accepted standard of living that we constantly have
%access to a mobile device which is basking in a sea of Wifi hotspots.
User mobile devices are nowadays constantly in a sea of WiFi hotspots.  By recording the observed WiFi signals over time, it is possible for the mobile
phone to deduce the salient locations in its environment, and the mobility
patterns of the user.  In real life, fluctuations of WiFi hotspots and unreliability of mobile phone antenna necessarily create false or missed readings, making problems related to location identification particularly challenging.

We propose a family of algorithms to perform the tasks of location identification, mobility inference, and localization.  Our algorithms
are able to handle real-life noisy readings, and construct a hierarchy of
salient locations providing a multiresolution model of the environment.
