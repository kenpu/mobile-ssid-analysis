Formally, the problem can be defined as such. We have millions of tuples related by some criteria (attributes). We want to visualize these 
tuples quickly and in a compact space to enable easy, intuitive visual identification of patterns and trends. We can use particular visual variables to accomplish this objective. One of the visual variables that we are using in the system is size, but representative size does not mean anything in particular in this paper.

Describe the model in depth and with specifics here. Use formulae and follow the formulae with descriptors of the role and importance of the variables involved.

The algorithm relies on a variation of the Verlet integration model. The integration model utilizes links between nodes and the force exerted by compressing or extending these links to draw nodes into place, using kinetic energy to shift elements. When extended to consider collision between nodes and edges, compactness is naturally achieved through the positioning and growth phases. The initial layout's undesired folds are resolved by injecting additional energy into the system, shifting nodes and their connections to remove overlapping branches of the tree.
